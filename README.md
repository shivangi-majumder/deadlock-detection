Dining Philisopher problem is the problem in synchronization in an operating system. We will adjust the current Dining Philosopher's Problem, initially proposed by Dijkstra in 1965. First we will perceive the situation of the Dining Philosopher's Problem. In such a problem, there is a dining room containing a round table with five seats. At each seat is a plate, and between each plate is a solitary fork. In the table is a bowl of spaghetti. Close to the room are five philosophers who invest the greater part of their energy thinking, however who every so often get hungry and need to eat so they can think some more. So as to eat, a philosopher must sit at the table, get the two forks to one side and right of a plate, at that point serve and eat the spaghetti on the plate.

Take the file in your system and run the java file. You're good to go.
Enjoy!
